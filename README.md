# PaperSpin-LS
PaperSpin-LS is a prototype-ready concept for an ultra-low-cost 3D laser scanner designed to make 3D scanning accessible to students, hobbyists, and small studios.  The project focuses on reducing hardware cost and complexity by using passive rotation and basic laser triangulation instead of motors and encoders.  ---
